Do you like Doom?

Do you like Graph Databases?

Then this is for you!

## Building
Use the gradle wrapper...

```bash
$ ./gradlew distTar
```

or...

```cmd
C:> gradlew.bat distZip
```

## Running
Assuming you've unpacked the dist zip/tar somewhere...

```
$./bin/gradle -h
```

Take a look at the args and then figure out what to set. I'll update the docs later :-)
